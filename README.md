# SuggestMe - iOS application

*SuggestMe* project was a utility app for everyday life; its purpose was to make the users capable
of asking questions from a set of different categories (social life, social interactions, hi-tech, fashion, etc...).

A team of people was always ready to provide the user with the best answer, putting together
information from the necessary resoures and thus avoiding the user to spend time looking for an anwer by itself.

After a few years the project has been abandoned.
